# Dotfiles

Some of my configuration files and resources I use everyday. I do my best to keep them readable and useful to everyone.

## vimrc
Cherry-picked plugins, bunch of customizations and (hopefully) not-too-invasive keybindings. Make sure you've read it first before applying.

## zshrc
Awesome command prompt I always wanted, using oh-my-zsh. 
It has autocompletion, fuzzy finder, fasd (frecent file finder), Powerlevel10k theme and bunch of improvements.

## tmux.conf
* Better defaults (in my opinion), such as CTRL+a as prefix, faster key repetition, numbering from 0, Alt key switching between panes etc.
* Vim copy, works with OS X.
* CTRL+M for toggling mouse mode.
* Capture pane and open in Vim.
* A very nice theme I got from somewhere, cannot recall its source though.

## defaults.sh
My OS X settings and tweaks as a shell script.

## Brewfile
CLI stuff and Casks I use on OS X.
