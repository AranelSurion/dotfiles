# Dotfiles

Some of my configuration files and resources I use everyday. I do my best to keep them readable and useful to everyone. 

### vimrc
![Screenshot](screenshots/vim1.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

Cherry-picked plugins, bunch of customizations and (hopefully) not-too-invasive keybindings.

Depends: vim (>=8) (+python), vimplug, exuberant-ctags, silversearcher-ag (>= 0.29.1)

### bashrc

Nothing really fancy. Just sane defaults, Powerline and Fasd integration.

Depends: powerline, fasd
